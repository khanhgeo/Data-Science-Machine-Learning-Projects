# Applied Advanced Linear Regressions on Housing Price

This repo contains data, R code, and report for my DASC5420 course project. In this study, I develop housing sale price prediction models using several regression machine learning algorithms, including Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Principal Component, and Random Forest regressions.
